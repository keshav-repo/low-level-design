# Design Pattern case in Ecommerce application 

### Cases of Factory Design Pattern example in ecommerce application like amazon
In an ecommerce application like Amazon, the Factory Design Pattern can be applied in various scenarios to handle object creation and improve code maintainability. Here are a few examples:

1. Product Creation: When adding new products to the inventory, the application can use a factory to create instances of different product types based on user input. For example, the application can have a `ProductFactory` that takes the product type (e.g., "electronics", "books", "clothing") and returns an appropriate product object.

2. Payment Method Selection: During the checkout process, when a user selects a payment method, a factory can be used to create the corresponding payment processor object. For instance, a `PaymentProcessorFactory` can create instances of `CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, or `BankTransferProcessor` based on the selected payment method.

3. Shipping Method Selection: Similar to the payment method, when a user selects a shipping method, a factory can be used to create the corresponding shipping service object. For example, a `ShippingServiceFactory` can create instances of `StandardShippingService`, `ExpressShippingService`, or `PrimeShippingService` based on the selected shipping method.

4. Discount Calculation: When applying discounts to products, a factory can be used to determine the appropriate discount strategy based on various factors such as user type, product category, or promotional offers. The factory can return instances of different discount strategies, such as `PercentageDiscount`, `FixedAmountDiscount`, or `BuyOneGetOneFreeDiscount`.

5. Report Generation: When generating reports for different metrics (e.g., sales, inventory, customer analytics), a factory can be used to create the appropriate report generator based on the selected report type. For example, a `ReportGeneratorFactory` can create instances of `SalesReportGenerator`, `InventoryReportGenerator`, or `CustomerAnalyticsReportGenerator`.

These are just a few examples of how the Factory Design Pattern can be utilized in an ecommerce application like Amazon. The pattern helps encapsulate object creation logic, promotes loose coupling, and allows for flexibility and extensibility in handling different object types.


## Please give me all the class related to Product class. product class have productId, name, price, category using factory pattern
Here are the classes for the given scenario of different product types (Clothing, Electronics, Books) using the Factory Design Pattern:

1. Product (Abstract Class or Interface):
```java
public abstract class Product {
    private String productId;
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private String category;

    // Constructor
    public Product(String productId, String name, double price, String category) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
        this.category = category;
    }

    // Getters and Setters

    public String getProductId() {
        return productId;
    }

    public void setProductId(String productId) {
        this.productId = productId;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getCategory() {
        return category;
    }

    public void setCategory(String category) {
        this.category = category;
    }

    // Abstract method
    public abstract void displayInfo();
}
```

2. ClothingProduct (Concrete Product):
```java
public class ClothingProduct extends Product {
    private String size;

    // Constructor
    public ClothingProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category, String size) {
        super(productId, name, price, category);
        this.size = size;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for size

    public String getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public void setSize(String size) {
        this.size = size;
    }

    // Override displayInfo() method
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Clothing Product - " +
                "Product ID: " + getProductId() +
                ", Name: " + getName() +
                ", Price: " + getPrice() +
                ", Category: " + getCategory() +
                ", Size: " + getSize());
    }
}
```

3. ElectronicsProduct (Concrete Product):
```java
public class ElectronicsProduct extends Product {
    private String brand;

    // Constructor
    public ElectronicsProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category, String brand) {
        super(productId, name, price, category);
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for brand

    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }

    public void setBrand(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    // Override displayInfo() method
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Electronics Product - " +
                "Product ID: " + getProductId() +
                ", Name: " + getName() +
                ", Price: " + getPrice() +
                ", Category: " + getCategory() +
                ", Brand: " + getBrand());
    }
}
```

4. BooksProduct (Concrete Product):
```java
public class BooksProduct extends Product {
    private String author;

    // Constructor
    public BooksProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category, String author) {
        super(productId, name, price, category);
        this.author = author;
    }

    // Getter and Setter for author

    public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public void setAuthor(String author) {
        this.author = author;
    }

    // Override displayInfo() method
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Books Product - " +
                "Product ID: " + getProductId() +
                ", Name: " + getName() +
                ", Price: " + getPrice() +
                ", Category: " + getCategory() +
                ", Author: " + getAuthor());
    }
}
```

5. ProductFactory (Abstract Factory):
```java
public abstract class ProductFactory {
    public abstract Product createProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category);
}
```

6. ClothingProductFactory (Concrete Factory):
```java
public class ClothingProductFactory extends ProductFactory {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category) {
        // Additional logic specific to ClothingProduct, such as getting size
        String size = // get size based on productId or other logic

        return new ClothingProduct(productId, name, price, category, size);
    }
}
```

7. ElectronicsProductFactory (Concrete Factory):
```java
public class ElectronicsProductFactory extends ProductFactory {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category) {
        // Additional logic specific to ElectronicsProduct, such as getting brand
        String brand = // get brand based on productId or other logic

        return new ElectronicsProduct(productId, name, price, category, brand);
    }
}
```

8. BooksProductFactory (Concrete Factory):
```java
public class BooksProductFactory extends ProductFactory {
    @Override
    public Product createProduct(String productId, String name, double price, String category) {
        // Additional logic specific to BooksProduct, such as getting author
        String author = // get author based on productId or other logic

        return new BooksProduct(productId, name, price, category, author);
    }
}
```

With these classes, you can create different types of products (Clothing, Electronics, Books) using the appropriate factory. For example, you would use the `ClothingProductFactory` to create a clothing product by calling its `createProduct()` method, which will return an instance of `ClothingProduct`.

### Decorator Design Pattern example in ecommerce platform ?

In an ecommerce platform, the Decorator Design Pattern can be applied to enhance the functionality of product listings or shopping cart features. Here's an example:

1. Base Component:
   ```java
   public interface Product {
       String getName();
       double getPrice();
   }
   ```

2. Concrete Component:
   ```java
   public class ConcreteProduct implements Product {
       private String name;
       private double price;

       public ConcreteProduct(String name, double price) {
           this.name = name;
           this.price = price;
       }

       @Override
       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }

       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           return price;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Decorator:
   ```java
   public abstract class ProductDecorator implements Product {
       protected Product product;

       public ProductDecorator(Product product) {
           this.product = product;
       }

       @Override
       public String getName() {
           return product.getName();
       }

       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           return product.getPrice();
       }
   }
   ```

4. Concrete Decorators:
   ```java
   public class SaleProductDecorator extends ProductDecorator {
       private double discount;

       public SaleProductDecorator(Product product, double discount) {
           super(product);
           this.discount = discount;
       }

       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           double discountedPrice = product.getPrice() - (product.getPrice() * discount);
           return discountedPrice;
       }
   }

   public class GiftWrapProductDecorator extends ProductDecorator {
       private double giftWrapPrice;

       public GiftWrapProductDecorator(Product product, double giftWrapPrice) {
           super(product);
           this.giftWrapPrice = giftWrapPrice;
       }

       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           double totalPrice = product.getPrice() + giftWrapPrice;
           return totalPrice;
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, the `Product` interface defines the common functionality for products in the ecommerce platform. The `ConcreteProduct` class is a concrete implementation of the `Product` interface.

The `ProductDecorator` class is the base decorator class that implements the `Product` interface. It has a reference to a `Product` object and delegates calls to it.

The `SaleProductDecorator` and `GiftWrapProductDecorator` are concrete decorators that add additional behavior to the product. The `SaleProductDecorator` applies a discount to the price of the product, while the `GiftWrapProductDecorator` adds an additional cost for gift wrapping.

You can create and chain multiple decorators to add various features or modifications to the base product dynamically. For example, you can decorate a product with both sale discount and gift wrapping.

The Decorator Design Pattern allows you to enhance the behavior of product listings or shopping cart features without modifying the existing classes. It provides flexibility and modularity in extending the functionality of the ecommerce platform.

### Give me example of shopping cart features considering decorator pattern 
Certainly! Here's an example of how the Decorator Design Pattern can be used to enhance shopping cart features in an ecommerce application:

1. Base Component:
```java
public interface Cart {
    void addProduct(Product product);
    void removeProduct(Product product);
    double getTotalPrice();
}
```

2. Concrete Component:
```java
public class ShoppingCart implements Cart {
    private List<Product> products;

    public ShoppingCart() {
        this.products = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addProduct(Product product) {
        products.add(product);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeProduct(Product product) {
        products.remove(product);
    }

    @Override
    public double getTotalPrice() {
        double totalPrice = 0.0;
        for (Product product : products) {
            totalPrice += product.getPrice();
        }
        return totalPrice;
    }
}
```

3. Decorator:
```java
public abstract class CartDecorator implements Cart {
    protected Cart cart;

    public CartDecorator(Cart cart) {
        this.cart = cart;
    }

    @Override
    public void addProduct(Product product) {
        cart.addProduct(product);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeProduct(Product product) {
        cart.removeProduct(product);
    }

    @Override
    public double getTotalPrice() {
        return cart.getTotalPrice();
    }
}
```

4. Concrete Decorators:
```java
public class DiscountedCartDecorator extends CartDecorator {
    private double discount;

    public DiscountedCartDecorator(Cart cart, double discount) {
        super(cart);
        this.discount = discount;
    }

    @Override
    public double getTotalPrice() {
        double totalPrice = super.getTotalPrice();
        double discountedPrice = totalPrice - (totalPrice * discount);
        return discountedPrice;
    }
}

public class TaxedCartDecorator extends CartDecorator {
    private double taxRate;

    public TaxedCartDecorator(Cart cart, double taxRate) {
        super(cart);
        this.taxRate = taxRate;
    }

    @Override
    public double getTotalPrice() {
        double totalPrice = super.getTotalPrice();
        double taxedPrice = totalPrice + (totalPrice * taxRate);
        return taxedPrice;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Cart` interface defines the common functionality for the shopping cart. The `ShoppingCart` class is a concrete implementation of the `Cart` interface.

The `CartDecorator` class is the base decorator class that implements the `Cart` interface. It has a reference to a `Cart` object and delegates calls to it.

The `DiscountedCartDecorator` and `TaxedCartDecorator` are concrete decorators that add additional behavior to the shopping cart. The `DiscountedCartDecorator` applies a discount to the total price of the cart, while the `TaxedCartDecorator` adds tax to the total price.

You can create and chain multiple decorators to add various features or modifications to the shopping cart dynamically. For example, you can decorate the cart with both a discount and tax calculation.

The Decorator Design Pattern allows you to enhance the functionality of the shopping cart without modifying the existing classes. It provides flexibility and extensibility in adding features to the ecommerce application.



## 4. ChainOfResponsibility design pattern example in ecommerce application 

Certainly! Let's consider an example of how the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern can be applied in an ecommerce application:

Scenario: Order Processing in an Ecommerce Application

In an ecommerce application, when a customer places an order, the order goes through various stages of processing, such as payment validation, inventory check, fraud detection, and shipping confirmation. Each stage requires specific handling based on the nature of the order. We can use the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern to handle these order processing stages.

1. Handler Interface/Abstract Class:
```java
public abstract class OrderProcessor {
    protected OrderProcessor nextProcessor;

    public void setNextProcessor(OrderProcessor nextProcessor) {
        this.nextProcessor = nextProcessor;
    }

    public abstract void processOrder(Order order);
}
```

2. Concrete Handlers:
```java
public class PaymentProcessor extends OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Perform payment validation logic here
        // ...

        if (nextProcessor != null) {
            nextProcessor.processOrder(order);
        }
    }
}

public class InventoryProcessor extends OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Perform inventory check logic here
        // ...

        if (nextProcessor != null) {
            nextProcessor.processOrder(order);
        }
    }
}

public class FraudDetectionProcessor extends OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Perform fraud detection logic here
        // ...

        if (nextProcessor != null) {
            nextProcessor.processOrder(order);
        }
    }
}

public class ShippingProcessor extends OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Perform shipping confirmation logic here
        // ...

        if (nextProcessor != null) {
            nextProcessor.processOrder(order);
        }
    }
}
```

3. Client:
```java
public class OrderProcessingClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the order processors
        OrderProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
        OrderProcessor inventoryProcessor = new InventoryProcessor();
        OrderProcessor fraudDetectionProcessor = new FraudDetectionProcessor();
        OrderProcessor shippingProcessor = new ShippingProcessor();

        // Build the chain of order processors
        paymentProcessor.setNextProcessor(inventoryProcessor);
        inventoryProcessor.setNextProcessor(fraudDetectionProcessor);
        fraudDetectionProcessor.setNextProcessor(shippingProcessor);

        // Create an order
        Order order = new Order(/* order details */);

        // Start the order processing by passing the order to the first processor in the chain
        paymentProcessor.processOrder(order);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the following components:

- `OrderProcessor` is the abstract class defining the common interface for all order processors.
- `PaymentProcessor`, `InventoryProcessor`, `FraudDetectionProcessor`, and `ShippingProcessor` are concrete order processors implementing the `processOrder` method to handle specific processing tasks related to payment validation, inventory check, fraud detection, and shipping confirmation, respectively.
- The `OrderProcessingClient` sets up the chain of order processors by linking them together and starts the order processing by passing an order to the first processor in the chain (`paymentProcessor`).

When an order is processed, it goes through the chain of order processors. Each processor performs its specific processing task and, if necessary, passes the order to the next processor in the chain. This way, each processor focuses on its specific responsibility, and the order moves through the stages seamlessly.

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern allows for flexible and dynamic handling of order processing stages. It enables easy addition or removal of processors in the chain without affecting the client code. Additionally, it promotes loose coupling and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the order processing system in the ecommerce application.

### Another example of chain of responsibility 

Certainly! Here's another example of how the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern can be applied in an ecommerce platform:

Scenario: Product Discount Calculation

In an ecommerce platform, different types of products may have different discount calculation strategies based on their category, price range, or any other criteria. We can use the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern to calculate the discount for a product based on its specific category.

1. Handler Interface/Abstract Class:
```java
public abstract class DiscountCalculator {
    protected DiscountCalculator nextCalculator;

    public void setNextCalculator(DiscountCalculator nextCalculator) {
        this.nextCalculator = nextCalculator;
    }

    public abstract double calculateDiscount(Product product);
}
```

2. Concrete Handlers:
```java
public class ClothingDiscountCalculator extends DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        if (product.getCategory().equals("Clothing")) {
            // Perform clothing-specific discount calculation logic here
            // ...

            return /* calculated discount */;
        } else if (nextCalculator != null) {
            return nextCalculator.calculateDiscount(product);
        }

        return 0.0; // No applicable discount
    }
}

public class ElectronicsDiscountCalculator extends DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        if (product.getCategory().equals("Electronics")) {
            // Perform electronics-specific discount calculation logic here
            // ...

            return /* calculated discount */;
        } else if (nextCalculator != null) {
            return nextCalculator.calculateDiscount(product);
        }

        return 0.0; // No applicable discount
    }
}

public class BooksDiscountCalculator extends DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        if (product.getCategory().equals("Books")) {
            // Perform books-specific discount calculation logic here
            // ...

            return /* calculated discount */;
        } else if (nextCalculator != null) {
            return nextCalculator.calculateDiscount(product);
        }

        return 0.0; // No applicable discount
    }
}
```

3. Client:
```java
public class DiscountCalculationClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the discount calculators
        DiscountCalculator clothingDiscountCalculator = new ClothingDiscountCalculator();
        DiscountCalculator electronicsDiscountCalculator = new ElectronicsDiscountCalculator();
        DiscountCalculator booksDiscountCalculator = new BooksDiscountCalculator();

        // Build the chain of discount calculators
        clothingDiscountCalculator.setNextCalculator(electronicsDiscountCalculator);
        electronicsDiscountCalculator.setNextCalculator(booksDiscountCalculator);

        // Create a product
        Product product = new Product("Example Product", "Electronics", 100.0);

        // Calculate the discount by passing the product to the first calculator in the chain
        double discount = clothingDiscountCalculator.calculateDiscount(product);
        System.out.println("Discount: " + discount);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the following components:

- `DiscountCalculator` is the abstract class defining the common interface for all discount calculators.
- `ClothingDiscountCalculator`, `ElectronicsDiscountCalculator`, and `BooksDiscountCalculator` are concrete discount calculators implementing the `calculateDiscount` method to calculate the discount for products of specific categories.
- The `DiscountCalculationClient` sets up the chain of discount calculators by linking them together and starts the discount calculation by passing a product to the first calculator in the chain (`clothingDiscountCalculator`).

When a discount calculation is performed, the product is passed through the chain of discount calculators. Each calculator checks if it can handle the product's category and performs the specific discount calculation. If a calculator cannot handle the product's category, it passes the product to the next calculator in the chain. This continues until a calculator provides a valid discount or the end of the chain is reached.

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern allows for flexible and extensible discount calculation strategies based on product categories. It enables easy addition or removal of calculators in the chain without affecting the client code. Additionally, it promotes loose coupling and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the discount calculation system in the ecommerce platform.

### Is there any other design pattern to calculate the discount for different category

If there are different types of discounts for different categories of products, a suitable design pattern to handle this scenario is the **Strategy Design Pattern**. The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms (discount strategies) and encapsulate each algorithm into a separate class. This way, you can easily switch between different discount strategies at runtime without modifying the client code.

Here's an example of how you can use the Strategy Design Pattern for handling discounts in different categories of products:

1. DiscountStrategy Interface:
```java
public interface DiscountStrategy {
    double applyDiscount(double originalPrice);
}
```

1. Concrete Discount Strategy Classes:
```java
public class ClothingDiscountStrategy implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double applyDiscount(double originalPrice) {
        // Apply clothing-specific discount calculation logic
        // ...

        return /* calculated discount */;
    }
}

public class ElectronicsDiscountStrategy implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double applyDiscount(double originalPrice) {
        // Apply electronics-specific discount calculation logic
        // ...

        return /* calculated discount */;
    }
}

public class BooksDiscountStrategy implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double applyDiscount(double originalPrice) {
        // Apply books-specific discount calculation logic
        // ...

        return /* calculated discount */;
    }
}
```

3. Product Class:
```java
public class Product {
    private String category;
    private double price;
    // Other product properties and methods

}
```

4.  DiscountCalculator Class:
```java
public class DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product, DiscountStrategy discountStrategy) {
        return discountStrategy.applyDiscount(product.getPrice());
    }
}
```


5. Client Code:
```java
public class DiscountCalculationClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create products
        Product clothingProduct = new Product("Clothing", 100.0);
        Product electronicsProduct = new Product("Electronics", 200.0);
        Product booksProduct = new Product("Books", 50.0);

        // Create discount strategies
        DiscountStrategy clothingDiscountStrategy = new ClothingDiscountStrategy();
        DiscountStrategy electronicsDiscountStrategy = new ElectronicsDiscountStrategy();
        DiscountStrategy booksDiscountStrategy = new BooksDiscountStrategy();

        // Create DiscountCalculator instance
        DiscountCalculator discountCalculator = new DiscountCalculator();

        // Calculate discounts for products using the appropriate strategy
        double clothingDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(clothingProduct, clothingDiscountStrategy);
        double electronicsDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(electronicsProduct, electronicsDiscountStrategy);
        double booksDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(booksProduct, booksDiscountStrategy);

        System.out.println("Clothing Discount: " + clothingDiscount);
        System.out.println("Electronics Discount: " + electronicsDiscount);
        System.out.println("Books Discount: " + booksDiscount);
    }
}

```

In this example, the Strategy Design Pattern is used to encapsulate different discount calculation algorithms (strategies) into separate classes implementing the `DiscountStrategy` interface. Each concrete strategy class defines the specific discount calculation logic for its corresponding category.

The `Product` class has a `calculateDiscount` method that accepts a `DiscountStrategy` object as a parameter. This method delegates the discount calculation to the provided strategy object. By passing the appropriate discount strategy to the `calculateDiscount` method of a `Product` instance, you can apply the specific discount calculation logic for that category of product.

Using the Strategy Design Pattern, you can easily add new discount strategies for different categories without modifying the existing code. It promotes code reusability, flexibility, and separation of concerns by encapsulating the varying discount algorithms into separate classes.

### Can we modify above program applying solid principle and keeping same design pattern 

Certainly! To apply SOLID principles and enhance the design of the program while keeping the Strategy Design Pattern intact, we can make some improvements. Let's consider the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) in our modifications:

1. Create a separate class for the discount calculation logic:
```java
public class DiscountCalculator {
    private final Map<String, DiscountStrategy> discountStrategies;

    public DiscountCalculator() {
        discountStrategies = new HashMap<>();
        // Initialize the discount strategies for each category
        discountStrategies.put("Clothing", new ClothingDiscountStrategy());
        discountStrategies.put("Electronics", new ElectronicsDiscountStrategy());
        discountStrategies.put("Books", new BooksDiscountStrategy());
        // Add more categories and corresponding strategies as needed
    }

    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        DiscountStrategy strategy = discountStrategies.get(product.getCategory());
        if (strategy != null) {
            return strategy.applyDiscount(product.getPrice());
        }
        return 0.0; // No applicable discount strategy found
    }
}
```

2. Modify the Product class to remove the dependency on the DiscountStrategy:
```java
public class Product {
    private String category;
    private double price;
    // Other product properties and methods

    // Getters and setters

    // No calculateDiscount method in Product class
}
```

3. Client code:
```java
public class DiscountCalculationClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create products
        Product clothingProduct = new Product("Clothing", 100.0);
        Product electronicsProduct = new Product("Electronics", 200.0);
        Product booksProduct = new Product("Books", 50.0);

        // Create DiscountCalculator instance
        DiscountCalculator discountCalculator = new DiscountCalculator();

        // Calculate discounts for products
        double clothingDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(clothingProduct);
        double electronicsDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(electronicsProduct);
        double booksDiscount = discountCalculator.calculateDiscount(booksProduct);

        System.out.println("Clothing Discount: " + clothingDiscount);
        System.out.println("Electronics Discount: " + electronicsDiscount);
        System.out.println("Books Discount: " + booksDiscount);
    }
}
```

With these modifications, we have separated the responsibility of discount calculation from the `Product` class and moved it to the `DiscountCalculator` class. The `DiscountCalculator` class encapsulates the discount strategies for different categories and selects the appropriate strategy based on the product's category. This adheres to the SRP by ensuring that each class has a single responsibility.

Additionally, the program is now open for extension as new discount strategies can be added by creating a new class implementing the `DiscountStrategy` interface and registering it in the `DiscountCalculator` class without modifying the existing code, thus adhering to the OCP.

The overall design still follows the Strategy Design Pattern, allowing for flexible discount calculation based on the product category while promoting modularity and maintainability.

## Hirarchy of Product category using composite pattern
Sure! Here's an example of implementing the hierarchy of categories using the Composite design pattern:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component
interface CategoryComponent {
    void displayInfo();
}

// Composite
class Category implements CategoryComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<CategoryComponent> subCategories;

    public Category(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.subCategories = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addSubCategory(CategoryComponent subCategory) {
        subCategories.add(subCategory);
    }

    public void removeSubCategory(CategoryComponent subCategory) {
        subCategories.remove(subCategory);
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Category: " + name);
        for (CategoryComponent subCategory : subCategories) {
            subCategory.displayInfo();
        }
    }
}

// Leaf
class Product implements CategoryComponent {
    private String name;

    public Product(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Product: " + name);
    }
}

// Usage
public class EcommerceApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Category fashion = new Category("Fashion");

        Category apparel = new Category("Apparel");
        Category outWear = new Category("OutWear");
        Category bottom = new Category("Bottom");

        Category nonApparel = new Category("Non Apparel");

        Category vest = new Category("Vest");
        Category jacket = new Category("Jacket");
        Category jeans = new Category("Jeans");

        Product product1 = new Product("Product 1");
        Product product2 = new Product("Product 2");

        fashion.addSubCategory(apparel);
        fashion.addSubCategory(nonApparel);

        apparel.addSubCategory(outWear);
        apparel.addSubCategory(bottom);

        outWear.addSubCategory(vest);
        outWear.addSubCategory(jacket);

        bottom.addSubCategory(jeans);

        outWear.addSubCategory(product1);
        bottom.addSubCategory(product2);

        fashion.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `CategoryComponent` interface, which represents the common interface for both categories and products. The `Category` class implements the `CategoryComponent` interface and serves as the composite object that can have child categories or products. The `Product` class represents a leaf object in the hierarchy.

We create instances of the `Category` and `Product` classes to represent the different categories and products in the hierarchy. We add sub-categories and products to their respective parent categories using the `addSubCategory()` method. Finally, we call the `displayInfo()` method on the top-level category (in this case, "Fashion") to display the entire hierarchy.

This example demonstrates how the Composite design pattern can be used to represent a hierarchical structure of categories and products in an ecommerce platform. The composite structure allows for a consistent way of working with individual categories and compositions of categories, making it easier to manage and display the hierarchy.

## Scenario of Flyweight design pattern  in ecommerce application ? 

In an eCommerce application, the Flyweight Design Pattern can be used to optimize the memory usage and performance when dealing with a large number of similar objects, such as product variants, attributes, or options.

Let's consider a scenario where an eCommerce application needs to handle product variations, such as different sizes, colors, and prices for a specific product. Instead of creating individual objects for each product variant, the Flyweight pattern can be applied to share the common intrinsic state among similar product variants.

Here's how the Flyweight pattern can be applied in this scenario:

1. Define the Flyweight Interface:
   - Create an interface, such as `ProductVariant`, that defines the operations related to product variants, such as getting the price, size, or color.

2. Implement the Concrete Flyweight Class:
   - Create a concrete implementation of the `ProductVariant` interface, such as `ProductVariantImpl`, that represents a specific product variant.
   - The intrinsic state, such as the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and common properties, will be stored in this class and shared among multiple product variants.

3. Create the Flyweight Factory:
   - Implement a flyweight factory, such as `ProductVariantFactory`, responsible for managing and creating the flyweight objects.
   - The factory will maintain a cache or pool of shared product variant objects based on their intrinsic state (e.g., SKU).
   - When a new product variant is requested, the factory checks if it already exists in the cache. If found, it returns the existing object; otherwise, it creates a new object, adds it to the cache, and returns it.

By applying the Flyweight pattern in this scenario, the eCommerce application can benefit in the following ways:

- Memory Optimization: The common intrinsic state, such as SKU, is shared among multiple product variants, reducing memory consumption.
- Performance Improvement: The shared product variants can be accessed and reused efficiently, improving performance when dealing with a large number of product variations.
- Flexibility: New product variants can be easily added without impacting the existing codebase, as the Flyweight pattern promotes loose coupling and separation of intrinsic and extrinsic state.

Overall, the Flyweight pattern helps optimize the handling of product variations in an eCommerce application, leading to efficient memory usage and improved performance.

## any other scenario of flyweight pattern in ecommerce application with sample code in java 

Another scenario where the Flyweight Design Pattern can be applied in an eCommerce application is for managing product attributes or specifications.

Consider a situation where a product can have multiple attributes, such as size, weight, material, and color. Instead of creating separate objects for each product with all its attributes, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share and reuse common attribute objects across multiple products.

Here's an example of how the Flyweight pattern can be applied to manage product attributes in an eCommerce application:

1. Define the Flyweight Interface:
```java
public interface ProductAttribute {
    void display();
}
```

2. Implement the Concrete Flyweight Class:
```java
public class ColorAttribute implements ProductAttribute {
    private final String color;

    public ColorAttribute(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
    }
}

public class SizeAttribute implements ProductAttribute {
    private final String size;

    public SizeAttribute(String size) {
        this.size = size;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Size: " + size);
    }
}
```

3. Create the Flyweight Factory:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ProductAttributeFactory {
    private final Map<String, ProductAttribute> attributeCache;

    public ProductAttributeFactory() {
        attributeCache = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public ProductAttribute getAttribute(String attributeName) {
        ProductAttribute attribute = attributeCache.get(attributeName);

        if (attribute == null) {
            switch (attributeName) {
                case "color":
                    attribute = new ColorAttribute("Red");
                    break;
                case "size":
                    attribute = new SizeAttribute("Large");
                    break;
                // Add more cases for other attributes
            }

            attributeCache.put(attributeName, attribute);
        }

        return attribute;
    }
}
```

4. Usage in Client Code:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProductAttributeFactory attributeFactory = new ProductAttributeFactory();

        // Product 1
        ProductAttribute colorAttribute1 = attributeFactory.getAttribute("color");
        colorAttribute1.display();

        ProductAttribute sizeAttribute1 = attributeFactory.getAttribute("size");
        sizeAttribute1.display();

        // Product 2
        ProductAttribute colorAttribute2 = attributeFactory.getAttribute("color");
        colorAttribute2.display();

        // The color attribute object is reused for both products

        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, we have two concrete flyweight classes (`ColorAttribute` and `SizeAttribute`) that represent different product attributes. The `ProductAttributeFactory` is responsible for managing and creating the flyweight objects based on the attribute name requested. If the attribute already exists in the cache, it is retrieved and reused; otherwise, a new object is created and added to the cache.

The client code demonstrates the usage of the flyweight objects. Multiple products can share and reuse the same attribute objects, reducing memory consumption and improving performance.

You can extend this example by adding more concrete flyweight classes for other product attributes and expanding the factory accordingly.

The Flyweight pattern allows the eCommerce application to efficiently manage product attributes, reduce object duplication, and optimize memory usage, resulting in improved performance and flexibility.

## Suppose a Product class has attribute name, price, color, size. And the product has 3 variant on the basis of color and 3 variant on the basis of size. what is the best design pattern to design Product 

Based on the given scenario where a `Product` class has attributes like name, price, color, and size, and there are multiple variants based on color and size, a suitable design pattern to consider is the Builder Design Pattern.

**The Builder Design Pattern provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It allows for the creation of different representations of an object using the same construction process.**

Here's an example of how to design the `Product` class using the Builder Design Pattern:

1. Define the `Product` class:
```java
public class Product {
    private final String name;
    private final double price;
    private final String color;
    private final String size;

    private Product(ProductBuilder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.price = builder.price;
        this.color = builder.color;
        this.size = builder.size;
    }

    // Getters for the attributes
    // ...
    
    // Builder class
    public static class ProductBuilder {
        private final String name;
        private final double price;
        private String color;
        private String size;

        public ProductBuilder(String name, double price) {
            this.name = name;
            this.price = price;
        }

        public ProductBuilder color(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        public ProductBuilder size(String size) {
            this.size = size;
            return this;
        }

        public Product build() {
            return new Product(this);
        }
    }
}
```

In this design, the `Product` class has private fields for name, price, color, and size. The class also contains a nested `ProductBuilder` class that handles the construction of the `Product` object.

The `ProductBuilder` class provides methods to set optional attributes like color and size. Each method returns the builder instance, allowing for method chaining.

To create a `Product` object, you can use the `ProductBuilder` by following a step-by-step process:

```java
Product product = new Product.ProductBuilder("Sample Product", 9.99)
                    .color("Red")
                    .size("Large")
                    .build();
```

In the example above, we create a `Product` object using the builder. The builder allows us to set the optional attributes `color` and `size` as needed before calling the `build()` method to obtain the final `Product` instance.

This design pattern provides flexibility in constructing the `Product` object, as you can easily add or omit optional attributes based on the product variants. It also simplifies the object creation process, improves readability, and avoids long constructor parameter lists.

You can extend this pattern by adding additional methods to the builder for setting other attributes, adding validation logic, or applying default values.

By using the Builder Design Pattern, you can design the `Product` class to handle multiple variants based on color and size, while ensuring a clean and maintainable code structure.

## Best places to apply flyweight pattern in ecommerce platform 

In an eCommerce platform, the Flyweight Design Pattern can be applied in various areas to optimize memory usage and improve performance. Here are some potential places to apply the Flyweight pattern in an eCommerce platform:

1. Product Variants:
   When dealing with products that have multiple variants based on attributes like color, size, or style, you can apply the Flyweight pattern to manage and share the common intrinsic state across similar variants. Instead of creating separate objects for each variant, the shared attributes can be stored and reused, reducing memory consumption.

2. Product Attributes:
   In an eCommerce platform, product attributes such as color, size, weight, and material may be shared among multiple products. By applying the Flyweight pattern, you can manage and share the common attribute objects, avoiding unnecessary duplication and optimizing memory usage.

3. Currency Conversion:
   If your eCommerce platform deals with multiple currencies, you can use the Flyweight pattern to store and reuse the currency conversion rates. Rather than fetching and calculating the conversion rates repeatedly, you can share the rates among multiple currency conversion instances, reducing the overhead.

4. User Interface Components:
   In the user interface of an eCommerce platform, there might be reusable components like icons, images, or templates. By applying the Flyweight pattern, you can cache and share these common UI components, reducing memory usage and improving rendering performance.

5. Product Images:
   eCommerce platforms often deal with a large number of product images. To avoid unnecessary duplication and optimize storage, you can use the Flyweight pattern to cache and share the images. This approach can reduce the memory footprint and improve the responsiveness of image retrieval.

6. Shipping Information:
   If your eCommerce platform deals with shipping information, such as address details or shipping methods, you can apply the Flyweight pattern to share the common shipping information across multiple orders. This can help reduce memory consumption and improve the efficiency of order processing.

It's important to analyze the specific requirements and characteristics of your eCommerce platform to identify the areas where applying the Flyweight pattern can provide the most significant benefits in terms of memory optimization and performance improvement.

## Adapter design pattern in ecommerce application java ? 
In an e-commerce application, the Adapter design pattern can be applied in various scenarios where there is a need to adapt interfaces between different components or systems. Here's an example of how the Adapter pattern can be used in an e-commerce application:

1. Payment Gateway Integration:
   - Suppose your e-commerce application needs to integrate with multiple payment gateways, each with its own interface.
   - To standardize the integration and provide a unified interface, you can create an Adapter for each payment gateway, implementing a common Payment Gateway interface.
   - Each Adapter would internally interact with the specific payment gateway's API and adapt its interface to match the common interface.
   - This allows your e-commerce application to work with different payment gateways seamlessly, regardless of their individual interfaces.

2. Shipping Service Integration:
   - Your e-commerce application may need to integrate with various shipping services to handle order fulfillment and shipping.
   - Each shipping service may have its own API and interface for retrieving shipping rates, tracking shipments, and generating labels.
   - You can create Adapters for each shipping service, implementing a common Shipping Service interface.
   - The Adapters would interact with the specific shipping service's API and adapt its interface to the common interface.
   - This enables your e-commerce application to interact with different shipping services using a consistent interface, simplifying the integration process.

3. Inventory Management Integration:
   - Your e-commerce application may need to integrate with external inventory management systems to keep track of product availability.
   - Each inventory management system may have its own API and interface for querying and updating inventory data.
   - Create Adapters for each inventory management system, implementing a common Inventory Management interface.
   - The Adapters would interact with the specific inventory management system's API and adapt its interface to the common interface.
   - This allows your e-commerce application to seamlessly integrate with different inventory management systems, regardless of their individual interfaces.

By applying the Adapter pattern in these scenarios, you can achieve a standardized and unified interface between your e-commerce application and external components or systems. This promotes reusability, maintainability, and flexibility in integrating with various external services or APIs.

## Prototype design pattern real use case in ecommerce application 
In an e-commerce application, the Prototype design pattern can be used in various scenarios where there is a need to create new product instances based on existing prototypes. Here are a few examples of how the Prototype pattern can be applied in an e-commerce application:

1. Product Configurator:
   - In an e-commerce application that offers customizable products, such as clothing with different colors and sizes, the Prototype pattern can be used to create prototypes for each product variant.
   - When a customer selects a specific product variant and customizes it, a new product instance can be created by cloning the corresponding prototype and applying the customizations.
   - This allows the application to efficiently create new product instances without the need to construct them from scratch, saving processing time and resources.

2. Product Recommendations:
   - In an e-commerce application that provides personalized product recommendations to customers, the Prototype pattern can be used to create prototypes for different recommendation algorithms.
   - Each recommendation algorithm can be implemented as a prototype, and new instances can be created by cloning the appropriate prototype based on customer preferences and browsing history.
   - This enables the application to quickly create personalized recommendation instances without re-implementing the algorithms for each customer.

3. Pricing Strategies:
   - In an e-commerce application that applies different pricing strategies based on various factors like customer type, product category, or promotional events, the Prototype pattern can be used to create prototypes for each pricing strategy.
   - Each pricing strategy can be implemented as a prototype, and new instances can be created by cloning the relevant prototype based on the pricing parameters.
   - This allows the application to easily switch and create new pricing instances based on different strategies without modifying the existing codebase.

By using the Prototype pattern in these scenarios, the e-commerce application can create new instances efficiently, customize products, personalize recommendations, and apply different strategies without the need for complex instantiation or extensive modification of existing code. It provides flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in managing and creating instances in a dynamic e-commerce environment.

## Give me code for Product Configurator using prototype design pattern in ecommerce applicaton 

Certainly! Here's an example code for a Product Configurator using the Prototype design pattern in an e-commerce application:

```java
// Product interface
public interface Product extends Cloneable {
    void customize(String color, String size);
    void display();
    Product clone();
}

// Concrete product class
public class ClothingProduct implements Product {
    private String color;
    private String size;

    public void customize(String color, String size) {
        this.color = color;
        this.size = size;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Customized Clothing Product - Color: " + color + ", Size: " + size);
    }

    public Product clone() {
        ClothingProduct clone = new ClothingProduct();
        clone.customize(this.color, this.size);
        return clone;
    }
}

// Configurator class
public class ProductConfigurator {
    private Product prototype;

    public void setPrototype(Product prototype) {
        this.prototype = prototype;
    }

    public Product createProduct(String color, String size) {
        Product product = prototype.clone();
        product.customize(color, size);
        return product;
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a prototype product
        Product prototype = new ClothingProduct();

        // Set the prototype in the configurator
        ProductConfigurator configurator = new ProductConfigurator();
        configurator.setPrototype(prototype);

        // Create customized products
        Product product1 = configurator.createProduct("Red", "Small");
        Product product2 = configurator.createProduct("Blue", "Large");

        // Display the customized products
        product1.display();
        product2.display();
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Product` interface that defines the common methods for customizing and displaying a product. The `ClothingProduct` class is a concrete implementation of the `Product` interface. It maintains its own color and size properties and provides implementations for the customization, display, and cloning operations.

The `ProductConfigurator` class acts as a factory for creating customized products. It takes a prototype object and uses it as a blueprint to create new product instances. The `createProduct` method creates a new instance by cloning the prototype and then customizing it with the provided color and size.

In the client code, we create a prototype instance of `ClothingProduct` and set it in the configurator. We then use the configurator to create customized products by specifying the color and size. Finally, we display the details of the customized products.

By using the Prototype design pattern, we can efficiently create new product instances by cloning the prototype and customizing them based on the customer's requirements in an e-commerce product configurator.

## How to prototype design pattern for Pricing Strategies
To demonstrate the Prototype design pattern for Pricing Strategies in an e-commerce application, here's an example code:

```java
// PricingStrategy interface
public interface PricingStrategy extends Cloneable {
    double calculatePrice(double basePrice);
    PricingStrategy clone();
}

// Concrete pricing strategy classes
public class RegularPriceStrategy implements PricingStrategy {
    public double calculatePrice(double basePrice) {
        return basePrice;
    }

    public PricingStrategy clone() {
        return new RegularPriceStrategy();
    }
}

public class DiscountPriceStrategy implements PricingStrategy {
    private double discount;

    public DiscountPriceStrategy(double discount) {
        this.discount = discount;
    }

    public double calculatePrice(double basePrice) {
        return basePrice - (basePrice * discount);
    }

    public PricingStrategy clone() {
        return new DiscountPriceStrategy(this.discount);
    }
}

// Pricing Context class
public class PricingContext {
    private PricingStrategy pricingStrategy;

    public void setPricingStrategy(PricingStrategy pricingStrategy) {
        this.pricingStrategy = pricingStrategy;
    }

    public double calculateFinalPrice(double basePrice) {
        return pricingStrategy.calculatePrice(basePrice);
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create pricing strategies
        PricingStrategy regularStrategy = new RegularPriceStrategy();
        PricingStrategy discountStrategy = new DiscountPriceStrategy(0.2); // 20% discount

        // Create pricing context
        PricingContext pricingContext = new PricingContext();
        pricingContext.setPricingStrategy(regularStrategy);

        // Calculate and display prices
        double basePrice = 100.0;
        double regularPrice = pricingContext.calculateFinalPrice(basePrice);
        System.out.println("Regular Price: $" + regularPrice);

        pricingContext.setPricingStrategy(discountStrategy);
        double discountedPrice = pricingContext.calculateFinalPrice(basePrice);
        System.out.println("Discounted Price: $" + discountedPrice);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a `PricingStrategy` interface that declares the `calculatePrice()` method for calculating the final price based on a base price. The `RegularPriceStrategy` class is a concrete implementation of the `PricingStrategy` interface, which returns the base price without any modifications. The `DiscountPriceStrategy` class applies a discount to the base price and calculates the final price accordingly.

The `PricingContext` class acts as the context that holds the current pricing strategy. It has a `setPricingStrategy()` method to set the desired pricing strategy, and a `calculateFinalPrice()` method that delegates the price calculation to the current strategy.

In the client code, we create instances of the pricing strategies (`RegularPriceStrategy` and `DiscountPriceStrategy`). We then create a `PricingContext` object and set the desired pricing strategy. Finally, we calculate the final prices by calling the `calculateFinalPrice()` method and display the results.

By using the Prototype design pattern, we can easily create new instances of pricing strategies by cloning existing prototypes and switch between different strategies in the pricing context. This allows an e-commerce application to apply different pricing strategies dynamically based on customer types, promotions, or any other factors.

## Proxy design pattern 
Certainly! Here's an example of the Proxy design pattern in Java:

```java
// Subject interface
public interface Image {
    void display();
}

// Real subject class
public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading image from disk: " + filename);
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying image: " + filename);
    }
}

// Proxy class
public class ProxyImage implements Image {
    private String filename;
    private RealImage realImage;

    public ProxyImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image1 = new ProxyImage("image1.jpg");
        Image image2 = new ProxyImage("image2.jpg");

        // The real image is only loaded and displayed when necessary
        image1.display(); // The real image is loaded and displayed
        image1.display(); // The real image is already loaded, so it is directly displayed

        image2.display(); // The real image is loaded and displayed
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an `Image` interface that declares the `display()` method for displaying an image. The `RealImage` class is a concrete implementation of the `Image` interface, responsible for loading the image from disk and displaying it.

The `ProxyImage` class acts as a proxy or placeholder for the real image. It holds a reference to a `RealImage` object and delays the creation and loading of the real image until it is actually needed. When the `display()` method is called, the proxy checks if the real image has been created. If not, it creates a new `RealImage` object and delegates the display operation to it.

In the client code, we create instances of the `ProxyImage` class, passing the filename of the image. The images are not loaded and displayed immediately. They are only loaded and displayed when the `display()` method is invoked on the proxy object. The proxy ensures that the real image is loaded lazily, on-demand, and caches the real image for subsequent requests.

The Proxy design pattern is useful in situations where the creation and initialization of an object are resource-intensive or time-consuming. It allows us to control the creation and access to the real object, providing additional functionality or optimizations, such as lazy loading, caching, access control, or logging, without affecting the client's code that interacts with the proxy.

## Proxy design pattern use case in ecommerce application java 
In an e-commerce application, the Proxy design pattern can be applied in various scenarios. Here are a few examples:

1. Image Lazy Loading: In an e-commerce website, there may be product listings or galleries that display multiple images for each product. Loading all the images upfront can be resource-intensive and slow down the page loading time. By using the Proxy pattern, you can create a proxy object for each image and load the actual image only when it is requested to be displayed. This ensures that images are loaded lazily, improving performance and reducing resource consumption.

2. Access Control: In an e-commerce application, certain product information or features may be accessible only to specific user roles or after authentication. The Proxy pattern can be used to implement access control by creating a proxy object that checks the user's role or authentication status before allowing access to sensitive information or restricted features.

3. Caching: E-commerce applications often rely on retrieving data from external services or databases. To improve performance and reduce the load on these resources, the Proxy pattern can be used to implement caching. The proxy object can cache the results of expensive or frequently accessed operations, such as product recommendations or search results, and serve them directly from the cache when requested again, without hitting the underlying service or database.

4. Logging and Monitoring: In an e-commerce application, it's essential to track and log user activities, monitor performance, and capture errors. The Proxy pattern can be used to create proxy objects that wrap around critical components or services, allowing you to add logging and monitoring functionality without modifying the original code. The proxy objects can log method invocations, measure execution time, capture errors, and provide valuable insights for troubleshooting and optimization.

By applying the Proxy design pattern in these scenarios, you can add additional functionality, control access, improve performance, and enhance the overall user experience in your e-commerce application.

## Some example of bridge pattern in ecommerce application ?
```java
// Abstraction interface
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

// Refined Abstraction classes
class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    public CreditCardProcessor(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment: $" + amount);
        paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
    }
}

class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    public PayPalProcessor(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: $" + amount);
        paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
    }
}

// Implementation interface
interface PaymentGateway {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

// Concrete Implementation classes
class StripeGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment via Stripe: $" + amount);
        // Implement Stripe payment processing logic
    }
}

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment via PayPal: $" + amount);
        // Implement PayPal payment processing logic
    }
}

// Client code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentGateway stripeGateway = new StripeGateway();
        PaymentGateway payPalGateway = new PayPalGateway();

        PaymentProcessor creditCardProcessor = new CreditCardProcessor(stripeGateway);
        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalProcessor(payPalGateway);

        double amount = 100.0;

        creditCardProcessor.processPayment(amount);
        payPalProcessor.processPayment(amount);
    }
}
```

## Any case where we can apply state design pattern in ecommerce application 

```java
// OrderState interface
interface OrderState {
    void processOrder(Order order);
    void shipOrder(Order order);
    void deliverOrder(Order order);
}

// Concrete state classes
class PendingState implements OrderState {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Processing order...");
        order.setState(new ProcessingState());
    }

    public void shipOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot ship order, it is still pending");
    }

    public void deliverOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot deliver order, it is still pending");
    }
}

class ProcessingState implements OrderState {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Order is already being processed");
    }

    public void shipOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Shipping order...");
        order.setState(new ShippedState());
    }

    public void deliverOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot deliver order, it has not been shipped yet");
    }
}

class ShippedState implements OrderState {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot process order, it has already been shipped");
    }

    public void shipOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot ship order, it has already been shipped");
    }

    public void deliverOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Delivering order...");
        order.setState(new DeliveredState());
    }
}

class DeliveredState implements OrderState {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot process order, it has already been delivered");
    }

    public void shipOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot ship order, it has already been delivered");
    }

    public void deliverOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Cannot deliver order, it has already been delivered");
    }
}

// Order class
class Order {
    private OrderState state;

    public Order() {
        this.state = new PendingState();
    }

    public void setState(OrderState state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void processOrder() {
        state.processOrder(this);
    }

    public void shipOrder() {
        state.shipOrder(this);
    }

    public void deliverOrder() {
        state.deliverOrder(this);
    }
}

// Client code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Order order = new Order();

        order.processOrder(); // Output: Processing order...
        order.shipOrder(); // Output: Shipping order...
        order.deliverOrder(); // Output: Delivering order...

        order.processOrder(); // Output: Cannot process order, it has already been delivered
        order.shipOrder(); // Output: Cannot ship order, it has already been delivered
        order.deliverOrder(); // Output: Cannot deliver order, it has already been delivered
    }
}
```

## Give me another  example of ecommerce using Mediator Design Pattern
In an ecommerce application, the Mediator design pattern can be used to manage the communication and coordination between various components involved in the purchasing process. Let's consider an example where the mediator facilitates communication between the customer, shopping cart, inventory system, and payment gateway.

Here's a simplified implementation:

```java
// Mediator interface
interface EcommerceMediator {
    void addToCart(Product product, int quantity);
    void removeItemFromCart(Product product);
    void checkout();
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

// Concrete mediator class
class EcommercePlatform implements EcommerceMediator {
    private ShoppingCart shoppingCart;
    private InventorySystem inventorySystem;
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    public EcommercePlatform() {
        this.shoppingCart = new ShoppingCart();
        this.inventorySystem = new InventorySystem();
        this.paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();
    }

    public void addToCart(Product product, int quantity) {
        shoppingCart.addProduct(product, quantity);
    }

    public void removeItemFromCart(Product product) {
        shoppingCart.removeProduct(product);
    }

    public void checkout() {
        if (shoppingCart.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("Shopping cart is empty. Cannot proceed to checkout.");
            return;
        }

        if (!inventorySystem.checkAvailability(shoppingCart.getItems())) {
            System.out.println("Some items in the cart are out of stock. Cannot proceed to checkout.");
            return;
        }

        double totalAmount = shoppingCart.calculateTotalAmount();
        processPayment(totalAmount);
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
    }
}

// Client code
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EcommerceMediator mediator = new EcommercePlatform();

        Product product1 = new Product("123", "Laptop", 999.99);
        Product product2 = new Product("456", "Headphones", 99.99);

        mediator.addToCart(product1, 1);
        mediator.addToCart(product2, 2);

        mediator.checkout();

        /*
        Output:
        Payment of $1199.97 processed successfully.
        */
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an `EcommerceMediator` interface that defines the methods for adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, performing checkout, and processing payment.

The concrete mediator class `EcommercePlatform` implements this interface and internally manages the interactions between the shopping cart, inventory system, and payment gateway. It ensures that the necessary steps are performed in the correct order and handles potential errors or validation checks.

The client code demonstrates the usage of the Mediator pattern by creating an instance of the `EcommercePlatform` mediator and invoking methods to add items to the cart and perform checkout. The mediator takes care of coordinating the communication between the different components, such as validating item availability, calculating the total amount, and processing the payment.

By using the Mediator pattern in an ecommerce application, we can achieve better separation of concerns and maintainability. The mediator acts as a central coordination point, allowing the individual components to focus on their specific responsibilities while ensuring that they work together seamlessly. This promotes code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility in the ecommerce system.
